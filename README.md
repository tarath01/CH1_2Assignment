# <u>*Summary*</u>

Welcome to the Simple Checkout App!
--------------------------------
A grocery checkout app doesn't get more simpler than this. Wanna see what a little Javascript can do for your site then give this a try!<br>
<br>
The purpose of this program is to simulate a simple grocery check out as a web application. Just fill out the fields, click "Display Receipt", and watch the magic!
